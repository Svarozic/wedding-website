Three times she is asked whether she will give the garland off or have her head cut off. However, she has the right after each prompting to ask for something.

The groom is given a broom, the bride a dustpan.

You are incredibly kind-hearted, caring, generous, and every day you show me your love. You radiate so much love and positive energy that everyone around you feels your warmth. You are the light of my life, and I am unbelievably happy to love you. With you, I feel like nowhere else – natural, comfortable, without pretense. I am myself, I can open up to you and talk to you about anything, because I know you understand me and accept me exactly as I am. You are my confidante and my soulmate. Thank you for inspiring me to be a better person, better for you, for us, and for our future family. I fell in love with your kindness, optimism, compassion, and honesty, but also with your sweet quirks that always make me laugh and fill me with joy. Thank you for giving me the chance to love you. I can’t imagine my life without you, and I can’t wait to experience everything that awaits us together.
