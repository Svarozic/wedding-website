Currently, we are working on a possible shuttle option from Košice City and Michalovce to our location. Furthermore, we are trying to organize a way to connect people for possible carpooling. More information on that will become available later on.",

And, of course, the personnel at the venue all speak English as well.",
    "qSpeech": "Could I do a speech or add something to the program?",
    "aSpeech": "If you plan on making a speech or contributing in any other way, please contact us so we can organize the evening program. :)",
