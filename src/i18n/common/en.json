Three times she is asked whether she will give the garland off or have her head cut off. However, she has the right after each prompting to ask for something.

    "ivana": "We met in September five years ago in a dance school. From the very first class, I immediately noticed your smile. During the classes, I kept scanning the room for you and could hardly wait for us to dance together. After the classes, we would walk to the station together, and when we got there, we ended up standing there for another hour or two because I didn’t want our conversations to end, and to this day, they still haven't. With you, I can talk about anything, big or small, without judgment, and we never seem to run out of topics. Through our conversations, I fell in love with your humor and playfulness. You have an incredible ability to always cheer me up and make me laugh, no matter what challenges we face. Even when we are tired, sick, or having bad days, you always find a way to brighten my day. Your laughter makes every moment with you brighter and full of joy, and I am immensely grateful for that. You have become my greatest support. Your reliability and organization have brought stability to my life, perfectly balancing my spontaneous, adventurous, and somewhat wild nature. With you, I have found a true sense of home, and I deeply appreciate the peace and security I feel when I am with you. I knew I wanted to share my life with you when I noticed and felt the love, attention, and care you show your family and loved ones. Through your daily actions, you demonstrate your kindness, patience, and empathy. I am also inspired by your honesty, determination, and effort to work on yourself to become better in every aspect of life. Although we have different personalities, we share the same values, goals, and outlook on life. On top of that I feel that we have found a way for our differences to complement each other perfectly. I am excited to start this new chapter with you today. I promise to always be by your side, to love and support you through all the challenges and joys. Together, we make an incredible team, and I look forward to all the moments we will create together.",
    "peter": "Ivana, I always thought that standing in front of the altar would be one of the hardest and most stressful moments of my life. But today, as I stand here next to you, I know that’s not true at all. All the stress has disappeared because I am standing here with you, the woman I’ve been searching for my entire life. You are the one I’ve dreamed of and the one I thought was just a distant idea. And now, knowing you and being able to share my life with you, I consider it the greatest gift, the greatest happiness I could ever wish for. You are beautiful – not just on the outside, but on the inside as well. Your beauty lies not only in how you look, but more importantly, in the purity and kindness of your character. You are incredibly kind-hearted, caring, generous, and every day you show me your love. You radiate so much love and positive energy that everyone around you feels your warmth. You are the light of my life, and I am unbelievably happy to love you. With you, I feel like nowhere else – natural, comfortable, without pretense. I am myself, I can open up to you and talk to you about anything, because I know you understand me and accept me exactly as I am. You are my confidante and my soulmate. Thank you for inspiring me to be a better person, better for you, for us, and for our future family. I fell in love with your kindness, optimism, compassion, and honesty, but also with your sweet quirks that always make me laugh and fill me with joy. Thank you for giving me the chance to love you. I can’t imagine my life without you, and I can’t wait to experience everything that awaits us together. I look forward to our shared future full of love, laughter, and happiness – I look forward to every day I’ll spend by your side. I love you, I love you the most, and I will love you forever.",
